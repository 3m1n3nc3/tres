We're going to say thanks [andretchen0](https://github.com/andretchen0) for this incredible contribution.

## SKY

You can now create realistic outdoor scenes with the use of sky, which as the names implies it create sky gradients and more with just a few lines of code

This is  fancy wrapper of the addon [Sky](https://threejs.org/examples/?q=sky#webgl_shaders_sky)

```
<script setup lang="ts">
import { Sky } from '@tresjs/cientos'
</script>

<template>
  <TresCanvas>
    <TresPerspectiveCamera :position="[0, 100, 2000]" />
    <Sky />
  </TresCanvas>
</template>
```
Could be more simple?

A classical one, the svg loader component has arrived in cientos this release, a wrapper of the original [loader](https://threejs.org/docs/?q=svg#examples/en/loaders/SVGLoader) with basically one line of code (well two if you count the import üòÖ)

```
<template>
  <TresCanvas>
    <Suspense>
      <SVG src="/favicon.svg" /> // you can pass a path or a inline svg
    </Suspense>
  </TresCanvas>
</template>
```
You can find the official docs [here](https://cientos.tresjs.org/guide/loaders/svg.html)

<script setup lang="ts">
import { TresCanvas } from '@tresjs/core'

  </TresCanvas>
</template>

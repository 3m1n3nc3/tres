# v-log

### Problem

When you have to log your instance you have to use the template reference and then log them:

<DirectiveVLogCode />

And is A LOT of code just for a simple log right?

## Usage

With the new directive v-log provided by **TresJS**, you can do this by just adding `v-log` to the instance.

<DirectiveVLogUsageCode />

Note that you can pass a modifier with the name of a property, for example `v-log:material`, and will log directly the `material` property üòç
